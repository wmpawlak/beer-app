## Beer App
Simple app I made for one of the recruitment processes. What it does? It simply just downloads and renders out couple of beers. Down at the bottom there's a button fetch more beers. Top left corner there is changing Home/Favourites button. You can add beers to your favourites (personally I love the one in a squirrel). Their ids are stored in your local storage, so they should be available whenever.

## Motivation
Recruitment app :)
